# Form System
This is a project to explore different frontend and backend frameworks/technologies. The idea is that, if I have aspects of the system already built (e.g. the Backend/Frontend), it should be easy to use that as a foundation to try new technologies. 
## Background
All projects here are based off of an original Springboot/Vue project that's purpose was to allow a user to create, send, and view forms and their responses.
## Folders
### FrontendTypeScriptClasses
Basic frontend Typescript classes that are universal to all projects. Can be copied into a new project without issues. Also includes Cypress for testing. 
### SpringBootBackend
Just the SpringBoot backend with a MariaDB database. 
### SpringBoot-Vue
The original project. Uses a SpringBoot backend with MariaDB database and a Vue frontend using TypeScript. Includes Mockito for testing. 
### SpringBoot-React _(Not started)_
The original SpringBoot backend with a React frontend.
### SpringBoot-Sapper _(Not started)_
The original SpringBoot backend with a Sapper frontend.
### SpringBoot-Angular _(Not started)_
The original SpringBoot backend with an Angular frontend.
### SpringBoot-Ember _(Not started)_
The original SpringBoot backend with an Ember frontend.
## Why these languages?
React because Facebook uses it and a lot of job opportunities require experience in it. Sapper because it looks neat. Angular and Ember because they are two other well established frontend frameworks that I would like to learn.

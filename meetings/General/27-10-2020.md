# Meeting Notes

## Information
### Date
27/10/2020

### Members Present
Cade, Kyle, ~~Ilja~~

### Absences
Ilja absent due to network issues.


## Summary
### Purpose
To review proposed solutions by Stephen from emails and finding questions to ask for the upcoming meeting.

### Outcomes
- Later revisit SAML2 authentication once application is ready to handle auth requests.
- Construct forms procedurally based on a template.
    - Based on name?
    - Template used by system to create a valid spreadsheet.
    - Spreadsheet should keep track of sent/replied recipients.
- Email errors could be displayed in red near question title.
- Vue could be beneficial to reduce errors that could arise due to concurrent saves.
    - Example: Two people open the file, the person opening last saves first. Other person saves and overwrites previously saved data. To fix this when detected we will need some merge tool to allow the user to cherry-pick changes.
- Skip encoding for access URL and email inbox and base off of form name / section.
    - Example: Attendance section with a form of "CO600 - 27/10/2020". URL could be: "/attendance/CO600%20-%2027.10.2020"
